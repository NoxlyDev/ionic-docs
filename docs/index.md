## Overview

AETHERION SMP is a **Lifesteal survival world** built for intensity. Players gain hearts by eliminating opponents and lose hearts upon death. When hearts hit zero, players face a temporary ban or spectator mode—depending on the season configuration.

The server is fully playable on both **Java and Bedrock**, optimized for smooth gameplay.

A full cinematic trailer is coming soon.
